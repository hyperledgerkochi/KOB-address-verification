
In the current system, a user who require a domicile credential has to apply online and upload documents like ration card, any document to prove address and any document to proof address. The heading officer at the village/muncipality checks for the genuinity of the uploaded documents and conducts a local search about the person who applied for the document(Genuinity is proven solely on the expertise and experience of the officer). When he/she finds that the claims are right, he/she issues a digitally signed domicile proof which can be downloaded and printed by the user. This process takes atleast 2 days to be completed. The biggest challenge with this system is that the credential provided is, at the end, a paper credential, which can be forged very easily. Another issue with the current system is that the domicile credential can be, at any time, revoked by the issuing authority.
